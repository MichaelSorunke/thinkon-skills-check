This was implemented using Google Cloud Shell using Java 17 and Spring framework

Run using gcloud app deploy
It will give a url that can be used to test by adding "/users" after it for POST or GET requests e.g(https://my-thinkon-skills-check.uc.r.appspot.com//users)

Thanks and kindly consider my application.
